Notes 4/16

Regions of Memory
TEXT - executable code
DATA - initialized globals and static vars
BSS - uninitialized static/globals
(HEAP) - grows downward as dynamic memory allocated
STACK - contains auto, grows upwards

int a;
int b = 2;

f1(int x, int y) { //x and y go in stack for x86, otherwise in registers for x86-64
  int l;
  static int s;
  static int y=5;
  char *p;
    p = malloc(10);
    printf("%d\n", a); //globals are initialized to all zero bits
}
